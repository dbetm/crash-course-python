Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outer space that strike the 
Earth's atmosphere. These particles mainly consist of protons, with some heavier 
nuclei and a small fraction of positrons and electrons. Cosmic rays can have energies 
ranging from a few million electronvolts to over 10^20 electronvolts, and they come 
from various sources, including the sun, outside the solar system, and distant galaxies.

### Detection of Cosmic Rays Using Smartphones

The detection of cosmic rays using smartphones is a relatively recent development 
enabled by the use of smartphone cameras. These cameras contain CMOS (complementary 
metal-oxide-semiconductor) sensors, which are generally used for capturing images but 
can also detect high-energy particles. When a cosmic ray particle strikes these sensors, 
it can generate a trail of charged particles that create a temporary track of light, 
recorded as a streak in the image data.

#### How It Works

1. **Sensor Activation**: When not in use for photography, the camera sensor in a smartphone 
can still be activated by specific apps designed to detect cosmic rays.
2. **Detection Mechanism**: As cosmic rays hit the sensor, they produce small points or 
streaks of light due to the interaction of the rays with the silicon of the sensor. These 
interactions are similar to how traditional particle detectors, like those used in physics 
experiments, work.
3. **Data Collection**: Apps designed for cosmic ray detection use algorithms to analyze the 
captured images to distinguish between cosmic rays and other sources of noise or interference, 
such as radioactivity or environmental light.

#### Applications and Research

Researchers have proposed using networks of smartphones as a way to create a large-scale and 
cost-effective method of detecting cosmic rays. This method can complement more traditional
detection approaches and provide valuable data for studying cosmic ray intensity and distribution. 
For example, the CRAYFIS (Cosmic RAYs Found In Smartphones) project aims to use this technology to create a global network of smartphones that can detect cosmic rays, potentially increasing the detected volume of these particles significantly.

This approach is particularly useful for gathering large-scale data over wide geographical areas 
and can help in educational and citizen science projects, allowing the public to engage directly 
with cutting-edge physics research.
